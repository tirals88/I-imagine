These days I wondered very seriously whom I could be, what I want to do. And I didn’t find what I want to do. 
But I found that I may expect studying more about programming such as python and deep learning and math modeling (despite I don’t know anything about this).

Luckily, I saw some job posters. 
They were from PEARL ABYSS, LS Group, LG CNS. Above them, LG CNS recruits very many fields such as DX Engineer, Cloud Architecture, Cloud Application Modernization, ERP, Entrue Consulting, Data, and AI. 
In Data and AI fileds, they preferred the person who majored in computer engineering, IT, Industrial Engieering, Math, and Statistics.

So I thought that Applied Math field would be very huge. And I want to be in that field.

I searched the professors’ main research areas. And I sended a mail to Professor Kyungsoo Kim, of Applied Math, Kyunghee Univ. He is researching math modeling, applied math with medical engineering.
